# TransitDensity
##Abstract:
Development sites where transit access is abundant are naturally suited to growing denser. In Portland many already have, but some may have been overlooked. These sites present an opportunity for higher density residential development. This study investigates if there are sites in Portland where transit is plentiful but housing density is still sparse. Data from the US Census informs an analysis of over 17,000 blocks, blocks are scored on transit access and DU/Acre, and results show a gradient of blocks with the highest potential for residential growth.
