##Abstract:
###Portland has one of the nations best public transit systems.
It also continues to densify as it grows and pushes against it's Urban Growth Boundary. One challenge of that growth is knowing which areas may benefit most from the increased density.

Sites where transit access is abundant are naturally suited to growing denser, and many already have, but some may have been overlooked. These sites present an opportunity for higher density residential development. This study investigates if there are sites in Portland where transit is plentiful but housing density is still sparse.
